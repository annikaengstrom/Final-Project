# Social-Liberalism-Across-Demographics

Attitudes towards gay rights vary greatly across demographics in the US. 

Gay rights have been one of the most contentious issues in the US in recent times. The 2017 General Social Survey collected data on attitudes towards various elements of gay rights. My app allows you to investigate these variations across chosen subgroups of the US population.

[This article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/05/23/same-sex-marriage-poll-americans/638587002/), found in USA Today, describes a new dawn in America's attitude towards gay rights and a record high in acceptance of gay marriage based on a Gallup poll. In my app, you can not only see which populations pull this trend up and which pull it down. The American population is diverse and multifaceted, and differences in ideologies and viewpoints across demographics have shaped this nation for years.

There is an extremely clear trend when it comes to looking at the effect of age on views on gay rights. The younger the respondent, the more liberal and accepting the views become. When it comes to the question of same-sex marriage, the responses transition from averaging positive to averaging negative at roughly age 45, which means these people would have been born in the early 1970’s. 

The 70’s in the United States had many important moments in gay history, ignited by the Stonewall Riots in New York City in 1969, both in politics with the first openly homosexual man elected to public office and in pop culture, with celebrities like Andy Warhol and Freddie Mercury “coming out” during this decade. 

Perhaps obviously, those who have never been married are more likely to be in favor of all types of gay rights. This is most likely because homosexuals themselves are most likely to fall into this category, with same-sex marriage only legalized nationally by a series of Supreme Court rulings in mid-2015. Furthermore, younger people, who we also see are more pro-gay rights, are likely to fall into this category. 

Conversely, the least socially liberal category, when it comes to gay rights is, overwhelmingly, the widowed population. However, I would assume that this is due to the average age of this population. Those who are married is the category which follows closely behind widows and widowers. One could attribute this to the connection between religious piety and views on the sanctity of marriage, as well as average marriage rates in rural communities, with historically greater levels of social conservativism.  

On all issues apart from same-sex marriage, the approval rates on these gay rights issues are fairly even across the sexes. Female respondents did report slightly higher rates of agreement, but not noticeably so. When it comes to views on same-sex marriage, however, female respondents averaged a positive response, whereas male respondents averaged a negative response. It has been suggested that reasons for this could include a certain relatability between women’s rights issues and gay rights issues, which both hinge upon ending discrimination based on biological factors. 

There is only a very weak positive relationship to be seen between income and support for gay rights issues. This is most often attributed to higher levels of education, which most often leads to greater social liberalism. Interestingly, those of the lowest income bracket, <$1000 per year, never has the lowest acceptance rating. I would, however, attribute this to the fact that young people who are students and are not yet earning an income are included in this bracket. This means that a highly educated, young population is pulling this average down.

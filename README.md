# Social-Liberalism-Across-Demographics

Attitudes towards gay rights vary greatly across demographics in the US. 

Gay rights have been one of the most contentious issues in the US in recent times. The 2017 General Social Survey collected data on attitudes towards various elements of gay rights. My app allows you to investigate these variations across chosen subgroups of the US population.

[This article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/05/23/same-sex-marriage-poll-americans/638587002/), found in USA Today, describes a new dawn in America's attitude towards gay rights and a record high in acceptance of gay marriage based on a Gallup poll. In my app, you can not only see which populations pull this trend up and which pull it down. The American population is diverse and multifaceted, and differences in ideologies and viewpoints across demographics have shaped this nation for years.

My app suggests that, across the board, young people are most accepting of gay rights and that those of lower income and elderly people are still lagging behind. This is particularly visible in views on rights to marry.
